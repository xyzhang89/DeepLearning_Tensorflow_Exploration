# DeepLearning_Tensorflow_Exploration
## Introduction
This repo is an exploration of deep learning with Tensorflow based on the [Udacity Deep Learning Course by Google](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) and [Martin Gorner's Tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/01/learn-tensorflow-and-deep-learning-without-a-phd).

The target of this project is to train a model for image classification on [nonMNIST](http://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2011/09/notmnist-dataset.html) dataset. This dataset is designed to look like the classic [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset, while looking a little more like real data: it's a harder task, and the data is a lot less 'clean' than MNIST.

The files in the folder [Udacity](https://github.com/xyzhang89/DeepLearning_Tensorflow_Exploration/tree/master/Udacity) gives the homework solution of the Udacity Deep Learning Course. The jupyter notebook [notMNIST_DeepLearning_Tensorflow.ipynb](https://github.com/xyzhang89/DeepLearning_Tensorflow_Exploration/blob/master/notMNIST_DeepLearning_Tensorflow.ipynb) gives the model training pipeline for the image classification problem. In this project, Logistic Classification, Fully-Connected NN and Convolutional NN are utilized in training the model. The best model is realized by LeNet with test accuracy of 93%.
